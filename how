1. Install Required Plugins:
Make sure you have the following plugins installed in your Jenkins instance:
Pipeline: Allows you to define build pipelines using code.
GitHub: Integrates Jenkins with GitHub repositories.
2. Create a New Pipeline Job:
Go to your Jenkins dashboard and click on "New Item".
Enter a name for your job and select "Pipeline" as the job type, then click "OK".
3. Configure Pipeline Script:
In the pipeline script section of your job configuration, you can define the pipeline steps using Groovy syntax. Here's an example pipeline script to pull a GitHub repository:

pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                // Checkout the code from GitHub repository
                git 'https://github.com/username/repository.git'
            }
        }
        // Add more stages as needed
    }
}


Replace https://github.com/username/repository.git with the URL of your GitHub repository.

4. Save and Run the Job:
Save your job configuration and then run the job. Jenkins will execute the pipeline script, which will pull the code from the specified GitHub repository.
Configure GitHub Credentials (Optional):
If your GitHub repository is private or requires authentication, you can configure GitHub credentials in Jenkins and use them in your pipeline script. Here's an example of how to do this:


pipeline {
    agent any
    environment {
        // Define GitHub credentials
        githubCredentials = credentials('GitHubCredentials')
    }
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                // Checkout the code from GitHub repository using credentials
                git credentialsId: 'githubCredentials', url: 'https://github.com/username/repository.git'
            }
        }
        // Add more stages as needed
    }
}



Replace 'GitHubCredentials' with the ID of your GitHub credentials in Jenkins.
